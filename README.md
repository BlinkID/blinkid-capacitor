# BlinkID SDK Capacitor plugin

This repository contains Capacitor wrappers for BlinkID native SDKs ([iOS](https://github.com/BlinkID/blinkid-ios)
and [Android](https://github.com/BlinkID/blinkid-android)). Not all features of native SDKs are available. However, the wrapper is open source so you can add features that you need. For 100% of features and maximum control, consider using native SDKs.
